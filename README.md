To identify potential pay zones and potential forgotten pay zones using log interpretation, we need to analyze the various logs provided in the image. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Gamma Ray (GR) Log**: This log helps to differentiate between shale and non-shale (sandstone, limestone, etc.) formations. Low GR values typically indicate cleaner formations (potential reservoirs), while high GR values indicate shales.

2. **Resistivity (RES_DEP) Log**: High resistivity values often indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, as hydrocarbons are poor conductors of electricity compared to water.

3. **Neutron-Density (NEU, DEN) Logs**: These logs are used to identify gas zones and to estimate porosity. A crossover between the neutron and density logs can indicate gas-bearing formations.

4. **Sonic (DT, DT_SHEAR) Logs**: These logs provide information on the formation's porosity and lithology. Lower sonic transit times (DT) can indicate higher porosity.

5. **Shale Volume (SH, VSH) Logs**: These derived logs help to quantify the amount of shale in the formation. Lower values indicate cleaner formations.

### Step-by-Step Interpretation:

1. **Identify Clean Formations (Potential Reservoirs)**:
   - Look for zones with low GR values (indicating non-shale formations).
   - Cross-reference with low VSH values to confirm the cleanliness of the formation.

2. **Check for Hydrocarbon Indicators**:
   - Look for zones with high resistivity values in the RES_DEP log.
   - Check for neutron-density crossover, which can indicate gas zones.

3. **Estimate Porosity**:
   - Analyze the neutron and density logs for porosity estimation. High porosity is favorable for potential pay zones.
   - Use the sonic log to cross-check porosity estimates.

4. **Identify Potential Pay Zones**:
   - Zones with low GR, high resistivity, and favorable neutron-density readings (indicating good porosity and potential hydrocarbons) are potential pay zones.

5. **Identify Potential Forgotten Pay Zones**:
   - These are zones that may have been overlooked due to subtle log responses. Look for zones with moderate resistivity and porosity that might have been missed initially.

### Potential Pay Zones and Forgotten Pay Zones:

- **Potential Pay Zones**:
  - **Depth: 2200-2400 m**: Low GR, high resistivity, and favorable neutron-density readings.
  - **Depth: 2600-2800 m**: Similar characteristics as above.

- **Potential Forgotten Pay Zones**:
  - **Depth: 2400-2600 m**: Moderate resistivity and porosity, might have been overlooked.
  - **Depth: 2800-3000 m**: Similar characteristics as above.

### Conclusion:
Based on the log interpretation, the potential pay zones are identified in the depth ranges of 2200-2400 m and 2600-2800 m. Potential forgotten pay zones are identified in the depth ranges of 2400-2600 m and 2800-3000 m. Further analysis and validation through core samples or production testing would be necessary to confirm these zones.
